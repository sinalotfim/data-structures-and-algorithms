##### Perfect Tree

-   Every level except the **last level** is full of nodes.

##### Complete Tree

-   Eevery level except the **last level** is **completely filled** and the levels **are filled from the left to the right**.
-   Types
    -   Heap

##### Balanced Tree

-   ```Java
      height(left) - height(right) <= 1
    ```

##### Right Skewed Binary Tree / Left Skewed Binary Tree

-   The most worst tree is right skewed or left skewed tree, it's not tree, it's like linked list.

#### Self-Balancing Trees

-   AVL Trees (Aelson-Velsky and Landis)
-   Red-Black Trees
-   B-Trees
-   Splay Trees
-   2-3 Trees
